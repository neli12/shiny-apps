## My first shiny app

Hey there!

On June 2022 I started my journey to learn Shiny and how to deploy a dashboard or a webpage using R language. In this project, I will show you my learning path, chronologically.  
- June 7, 2022: I am working at the University of Leeds as a Newton International Fellow and I was tasked to find a way to deploy MRV protocols for soil organic carbon monitoring. Briefly, MRV means Monitoring, Reporting and Verification. In simple words, these are protocols used to confirm if there are gains or losses of soil organic carbon from agricultural, livestock or forestry systems. For this project, I will focus on agricultural systems. I decided first to write my ideas in the [Miro](https://miro.com/es/) app and define my strategy. I also read the MRV protocol proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN), which can be found [here](https://www.fao.org/documents/card/es/c/cb0509en/). After this brainstorming process, I decided to deploy a pilot project in Shiny. 
- June 8, 2022: I started searching tutorials on how to build a shiny app. The first obvious option was the shiny app webpage, available [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/), where I spent a few hours trying to learn the basics of a shiny app. I was able to learn about the main panel and how to use widgets. The `app_soc.R` will be updated as I include the main components.
- June 9, 2022: I learned how to add a widget to select an option from a set of available items.
